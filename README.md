# 📱 **QR Code Scanner using HTML, CSS & JavaScript** 🖥️

A **QR Code Scanner** allows users to scan QR codes and decode the data. This project will guide you through building a web-based QR code scanner that lets users scan QR codes either by uploading an image file or using their system's camera. After scanning, the application will display the decoded text from the QR code.

## 📝 **Prerequisites**:

Before starting, make sure you are familiar with the following:

- **HTML** 📄 (for creating the page structure)
- **CSS** 🎨 (for styling the page and making it visually appealing)
- **JavaScript** 💻 (for adding functionality and integrating QR code scanning)
- **QR Code Scanning Library** (we'll use `html5-qrcode` to scan QR codes)

You will also need:

- A text editor like **VSCode** ✍️
- A web browser 🌐 to run the application

## 🚀 **Approach**:

### 1. **HTML Structure**:
- Create a folder for the project and include three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
- Define the basic structure in the `index.html` file using HTML elements like `<div>`, `<input>`, `<button>`, and others.
  - The HTML will allow users to upload an image or activate the camera to scan the QR code.

### 2. **CSS Styling**:
- Style the page using CSS to make the page attractive and user-friendly.
  - This will include styling for the page layout, buttons, input fields, and scan results.

### 3. **JavaScript Functionality**:
- Add interactivity using JavaScript, such as handling events and implementing the QR code scanner.
  - Use the `html5-qrcode` library, which can be included via CDN to handle QR code scanning from both image files and the camera.
  - When the user uploads an image or activates their camera, the QR code will be decoded, and the result will be displayed in an alert or on the page.

### 4. **QR Code Scanning Library**:
- To make the QR scanning functionality possible, use the **html5-qrcode** library by including the CDN in the HTML.
  - This library will handle the decoding of QR codes from both images and live camera feeds.
